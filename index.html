        <p id="text1" class="introtext">
            <b>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</b> have transformed the landscape of warfare and extended the boundaries of what was previously considered impossible. According to Cole and Wright (2010), <i>“Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are aircraft either controlled by ‘pilots’ from the ground or increasingly, autonomously following a pre-programmed mission."</i>.
        </p>

        
        <p id="text2" class="introtext">
            On modern battlefields, UAVs play a crucial role by providing real-time intelligence and conducting precise strikes on enemy targets, offering significant tactical advantages. This paper explores the impacts of UAVs on modern warfare, beginning with an overview of their history, followed by an analysis of their effects on modern conflicts, and concluding with a discussion of their future implications.

            The First Drone
        </h3>
        
        <p id="text3">When talking about UAVs, many believe that they are recent innovations from the beginning of the 2000s, but only a few know that there is a not-so-short history of UAVs that dates back more than 100 years ago. Throughout history, humans have launched all manner of objects into the sky above, but some of the first attempts at doing so in a controlled manner happened in World War I.</p>
        <p id="text3"> In 1917, <b>Charles Kettering</b> invented the first unmanned airplane carrying explosives nicknamed “Bug”, marking the First Drone Age. Hoping to change the tide of the war through aerial bombardment, the US Army intended to use the Kettering Bugs as unmanned aerial torpedoes, or what we nowadays call "guided missiles”. However, the Kettering Bugs never went into actual combat.</p>

        <p id="text4">After the Treaty of Versailles, which marked the end of The First World War, many militaries around the globe would continue experimenting with UAVs. Leading the charge, the US Air Force and the Royal Air Force began experiments in making radio-guided UAVs, which became essential in training the next generation of anti-aircraft gunners and pilots.</p>

            The Use of Drones in Cold War
        </h3>

        <p id="text5">By the Cold War, the desire to use UAVs to conduct reconnaissance missions had increased dramatically. During the Vietnam War, American drones, such as the Ryan Model 147 "Firebee", were used for reconnaissance missions and as decoys to divert North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire away from US-manned military aircraft. It is estimated that drones have carried out approximately 3000 missions during the Vietnam War (Axe, 2021).</p>
